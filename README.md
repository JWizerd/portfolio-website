# NOTES FOR REVIEWER #

## Your Goals: TO EXCEED YOUR EXPECTATIONS ##

* When I saw the initial mock up for Project 1 I knew that for me, since I do have 2 years of experience with some front end development, that layout would be too easy.
* So I have taken about 8 hours to create this to standard based off of the Project Rubric. However, there are a couple things I want to address about my mark up.
* I have used both bootstrap and flex box because I wanted to see how they work together.
* My layout is responsive without extensive media queries due to both of tools so I believe they worked great for me in that it saved me time.
* In the beginning header section you will notice that I have left out the .container for the .row and .col grid layout.
* I did this on purpose so that I could achieve a 100% width and still take advantage of bootstrap's responsive design.

## If possible I would like these things to be taken into consideration since I understand the guidelines but I felt that in the given situation it work better for me
## to bypass some of the guidelines for strategic purposes. However, I'm not an expert designer (obviously or I wouldn't be taking this course lol) but I wanted you to know 
## so that maybe there will be a possibility that these won't effect my passing of this project. Thanks for all awesome feedback in advance!! - Jeremiah
